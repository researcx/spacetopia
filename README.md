# Spacetopia

A side project which was never finished, intended to bring Second Life-style features and customization into Space Station 13.

"Project Spacetopia is an outpost for science, trade and diplomacy. It is ran by a coalition of different races, governments and planets, and is held under an independent non-profit corporation.  
It has roughly the area of two football fields and has living areas designed to accommodate various alien species and individuals.  
The outpost and its assets are maintained by its loyal engineering and medical staff.  
Security guards are deployed to protect the outpost's assets (property, individuals, money, etc.) from various hazards such as waste, damaged property, unsafe worker behavior, criminal activity) by utilizing preventative measures."
