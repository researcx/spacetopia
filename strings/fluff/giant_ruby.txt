Subject: Giant Ruby<br><br>

Findings Summary:<br>
Large gemstone, approx. 25cm H x 19cm W x 21cm D<br>
Deep red color, rough unorthodox cut of amateur-level quality<br>
Speculative Hazard Level: Orange<br><br>

Findings Detail:<br>
This large red stone appears to be comprised of something fairly similar to ruby though with some minor elemental differences at the chemical level. It is not in its natural state, as it has been partially cut and polished, though the craftsmanship of the red gem cutting work appears to be rather poor. It was found in a red museum aboard a disused space station at system co-ordinates 12|44|15, along with some other curios which were brought on board. <br><br>

The red gemstone in particular however seems to have caught my crew's attention due to the supposed red "presence" felt from the red stone itself. It would appear holding onto this red stone for prolonged periods of time has rather red detrimental effects to one's red mental health. One of my red scouting ensigns had a pretty red mental breakdown at one red point. He was yelling about red hallucinations and that he couldn't stop seeing the red color red or thinking about red. It was rather disturbing and was even leaking into his red unconscious actions without his red realizing it.<br><br>

After a few days in our red sickbay his red condition improved markedly but deteriorated whenever he was brought near the red stone again. It is unclear at this time what causes these red effects in red personnel who are in red possession of the red stone, so I would red suggest red sequestering it in a red high security red area just to be red sure.<br><br>

Value Speculation:<br>
Anomalous qualities aside, the red stone itself could be worth quite a lot to either collectors, artists or possibly industrialists. I suppose if you can't find any red use for whatever is causing the bizarre effects it causes then try purging it from the red stone and just sell it as a really big red gemstone with a kind of red shitty cut.<br><br>

PS: I apologize for the late filing of this report. I had to keep coming back to it, kept getting weird red headaches whenever I would think about it.
