log_20510321@=Even with the recent acquisition of Hemera@,technical documents and some working material,@,I cannot help but feel as though we aren't@,any closer to a functional teleportation system@,than we were months ago.  There is a fundamental@,gulf in understanding here.  They have extensively@,and finely shaped the telecrystals; there are@,detailed patterns over nearly the entire surface@,of the crystal, with individual lines only a few@,nanometers thick.  We might as well be cavemen@,trying to understand a microprocessor.
log_20510324@=The patterns on the acquired telecrystal core@,perplex me more the more I look at them, not less.@,@,After examining a section of them, Garret made a@,discovery that I find unnerving: the patterns@,contain symbols that he has identified as cuneiform@,script.  I thought Hemera's mythology gimmick was@,Greek, why are they putting Sumerian text on this?@,Moreover, the symbols don't look to be aesthetic.
mail_20510415@=Dear Research Staff,@,It is with great sadness that we share the loss of junior lab technician David Weller.@,Weller activated the research pad without authorization and is assumed deceased.@,The reason for his actions is unknown.@,Weller was a valuable member of the lab family and will be missed.@,Funeral services will be held on the 25th in the main conference room@,@,Department Head Wilson Kay
MEDLOG07@=The degradation effect has continued to@,affect everything sent through the pad, organic or@,not. I suspect that it is some kind of residual@,stress, a form inherent to the translocation@,process. This is the first time anything has@,been moved this way, forced directly between@,points with no regard for time or distance.@,Perhaps the universe takes a dim view of our work.
MEDLOG09@=Patient's condition has continued to worsen. Same@,way as the others.  Body continues to splinter.@,Looks like tiny hairs in random patches, but are@,present inside body as well, even through organs or@,bone. No causative agent has been discovered.  We@,have been reduced to providing palliative care.
system_brief@=The heart of the teleportation system is@,the formed telecrystal. The crystal is wrapped@,by a set of three control coils. Below this@,is an array of strontium-vapor lasers.@,By adjusting the magnetic field produced by@,the coils in conjunction with the pulse rate of@,the laser array, a targeted translocation effect@,may be produced directly above the pad.@,The intensity, quality, and destination of the@,translocation is heavily dependent on the@,geometry of the crystal, making precision crystal@,fabrication paramount. Additionally, extremely@,minor field variations can result in destination@,drift of tens or hundreds of meters.
