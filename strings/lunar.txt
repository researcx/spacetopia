mary_stories@=Once I saw a guest eat an entire roast chicken.  He just carried it around and ate parts off of it.  He even ate the bones.@,Once some weirdo went through an entire tour while wearing the ugliest mascot costume I have ever seen.  Like, a blue wolf or cat or something with a misshapen head and uneven limbs.  He wore it into the restrooms and got stuck in a stall.  Nobody found him until the next day.@,I think pears are the best fruit.  I cannot eat them, but they're shaped like light bulbs and that's nifty.
