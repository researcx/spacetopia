O workin on it
X IT'S SIMPLY DONE

todo:
O SPONGES
	O dump stuff on sponges
	* interaction with the big mop bucket, popup with the options "dry" or "wet"
* half-capacity jetpack/storage for syndicates, maybe one spawns in the CE's office?
* pay money to centcom to make the supply shuttle come faster
* individual item QM thing? how do we determine the value of items without manually setting a var for each object :/

old todo:
* remove thermals wallhack & make them work like an IR camera
* FORENSICS REWRITE
* luminol picks up blood on clothes
* eye surgery?
* rewrite icon/proc/attack (probably just ask sniper to do everything because hoooooly shit)

etc:
Electrical charge test shows residual insulation material left on the [inspected thing].
