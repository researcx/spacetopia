ITEMS TO ADD:
	Atmospherics Interface Elements

ADD NEW POWER REACTOR (where 'engine' is)
	Will be a nuclear fusion -> steam plant design
	Will use intertial confinement model for maximal chance of... accidents
	
	Necessary compinents:
		Fuel Preparation Subsystem - grabs H2 and forms fuel pellets, preheats them somewhat, loads into fuel injection system
		Laser Generation Subsystem - creates, focuses, and directs the VERY HIGH energy laser for fuel ignition
		Main Reactor Core - Accepts laser energy and fuel to produce heat
			Waste Disposal/Reactor Coolant - Keeps main reactor core operating properly
		Cooling Subsystem - Cools the steam/water down from the cold loop
		Control Room - monitors the status of everything

	Possible points of failure:
		Laser components burn out/need replaced - laser no longer has enough energy for ignition
		Reactor Core overheats and degrades (especially if run at high output) - heat pours out into environment
		Core Coolant Rods deplete - thermal runaway
		etc.

CONCEPTS TO IMPLEMENT:
	High pressure causes windows to shatter

	Human movement on space tiles
