~*~ OK I think I've hashed it out and here is the entire Manufacturing/Recycling process ~*~
*~* Note: I might change some of this later. Or not. Who knows. *~*

All current objects should be recyclable and broken down into three raw materials.

Scrap Materials:
   Metal Scrap
   Glass Scrap
   Carbon Scrap (This is sort of a catch-all for anything that doesn't fall into the first two categories. So things like clothing, plastics, even biomaterials e.g. food, etc.)

Raw Materials:
   Metal Ore
   Silicate Ore (for glass)
   BioPlastic (*new* can be made from plants)


Recycling Objects:

[*] Grinder
   Grinds disposed items into scrap metal, glass, carbon, or some combination thereof

[*] Seperator
   Seperates scrap into its components.


Manufacturing objects:

Each tier of manufacturing objects can create both items of increasing complexity, and the requisite components to create the higher tier manufacturing objects.

TIER 1

[*] Induction Furnace
   Melts scrap metal/glass and/or ore into molten sheets.

[*] Press Forge
   Takes molten metal and presses it into flat or angular forms. (Tiles, etc.)

[*] Wire / Rod Mill
   Takes molten metal and mills it into rods or wire.

[*] Metal Roller
   Takes molten metal and creates cylindrical or conical forms. (pipes, etc.)

TIER 2

[*] BioPlastics Extruder
   Enables plastics production. Can create plastic profiles.

[*] Welding Torch Table
   Takes tier 1 metal forms and can cut more complex metal forms.

[*] IronWorker
   Takes tier 1 metal forms and can create more complex metal forms.

TIER 3

[*] CNC Laser Cutter
   Takes tier 2 metal forms and can cut more intricate, precision designs.

[*] CNC Surface Grinder
   Takes tier 2 metal forms and can create more intricate, precision designs.

[*] 3D Printer
   Can create printed plastic parts

TIER 4

[*] CNC Multimachine
   An all purpose machine tool that can perform all the functions of an entire machine shop by itself. (Think autolathe. It's actually a real thing, check it out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimachine )

[*] CNC Circuit Mill
   Can create electronic components, PCBs, etc. from precision tier 3 metal forms.
