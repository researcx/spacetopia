Lighting:
	- Fix objects with no lighting having their affected tiles list as not null, should give a theoretical (infinitely small) performance boost to del()

- Rewrite foam
- Rewrite build mode
- Rewrite the shuttle controller

- Cyborg click needs some work

- Do further work on clicking by adding attack()

Things which need layering adjustments:
	Cobwebs
	The boxing ring ropes

Fine tune explosions:
	Add brisance value
	Adjust mining explosives and welding tanks

optimize the shell tool menu?
same probably goes for the borg upgrade menu, remakes the screens

that or pooling for screen objects
