//CURRENT PROJECTS
////////////////////////////

- Organize and reduce verbs
	* High priority given to cleaning up the admin interface
	* Verbs should be moved into individual overarching menu windows that are accessed from ideally one tab (Admin)
	* Right click menu should be kept tidier
	* For normal players, verbs should be collected into one tab (e.g. Observe all on its own in the ghost tab urgh)

- Fix up admin code that stuff is a mess guhhhh

- Make the map the main and only element
- Apply other windows as map overlay type windows
- Convert the chat output box to a browser/html box


////////////////////////////
//PIPE DREAM PROJECTS
////////////////////////////

- Rewrite UI (with tobbas help)
	* New UI should:
		- Be asynchronous (update to game events in real time without stealing focus)
		- Not have OS bordered windows (if possible)
		- Draw from a CSS framework
		- Allow proper caching of resources (images etc)
	* Perhaps replace right click menus with skinned contextual menus (no idea if possible/a good idea)
	* Explore how to remove the verbs tabs entirely
		- Current verbs are fundamentally a poor way of interacting with commands
		- Alternative: an overlay over the game window showing graphical icons + text for each command (easy for player, less so for admins)
	* Explore how to make the chat window an overlay over the game so it doesn't take up half the dang screen
