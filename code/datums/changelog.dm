(*)Fixed some issues with human shields. They should work reliably now.
(t)mon feb 15 15
(u)Wire
(*)Swapped servers #1 and #5. Meaning #1 now runs destiny/RP mode and #5 now runs normal cogmap2 mode. This was done for performance reasons.
(t)fri feb 12 16
(u)Haine
(*)<b>Destiny only</b>: You can now return to cryosleep in the cryotron, if you have to leave for whatever reason. There's a 15 minute wait before you can leave cryosleep again once you enter. That time may be adjusted in the future.

(u)Haine
(*)Fixed the end-of-round nuke animation for successful exploding of the station.
(t)mon jan 25 16

(u)Wire
(*)New popups! Sorta. This is an introduction of a brand spanking new popup framework we're testing. As the end-user, you wont see much beyond an initial style change, but trust me some magic is happening behind the scenes.
(*)Yes this changelog looks a little janky with the new theme, will fix. Also if shit goes real south and your changelog can't be closed or whatever, just issue the "Changelog" verb and it will go away.
(*)(New popup framework coded largely by Somepotato)
(t)mon dec 07 15
(u)Haine
(*)<b>Destiny only</b>: Security Officers now have access to everywhere but heads' offices and other command locations (bridge/EVA/AI/etc). HoS now have all access plus their armory access. Please don't abuse this so I don't have to remove it again.

(u)SpyGuy
(*)Mercury no longer a stealth poison.
(*):getin:
(*)Also: paper hats. HAINE NOTE: YOU HAVE TO FOLD THEM NOW WITH A COMMAND BY RIGHT CLICKING ON THEM OR SOMETHING, SPY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT
(t)sun nov 29 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Tweaked how conveyor belts work. They should now be significantly faster. As such the cargo routing system can actually be used to deliver things in a timely manner!
(t)fri nov 27 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Fixed a long-standing issue with clown car reliability.
(*)This update brought to you by our sponsors, the Tinfoil Hat Society.
(u)Haine
(*)Mentorhelp is now hot pink.  This is partially (mostly) because mentorhelps were getting lost in admin PM messages since they were all the same blue color.
(*)F3 is now a hotkey for mentorhelp.
(t)wed nov 25 15
(u)Haine
(*)New wizard outfit available, made by Gannets!
(*)You can now cut eyeholes into cardboard boxes. You can also now put fake moustaches on them.
(*)Fixed syndicate saws so, when you see one in someone's hand, it's red, not green.
(t)fri nov 20 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)A brand new interface for the pathology computer. It's cool as heck.
(*)It's also kind of experimental, fitting for a sciencey department.
(u)Haine
(*)New/"New" HUD styles: Classic, the blue and green style from early goonstation days, and Mithril, a HUD style by quiltyquilty.
(*)Fixed: "You're too far away from the left hand to deal a card!"
(t)mon nov 16 15
(u)Haine
(*)New HUD sprites, courtesy of Bartorex! Additional thanks to Somepotato for setting up a dmi with the sprites, and letting me have said dmi, so I could be lazy.
(*)You can still use the old HUD! You'll find a new option in your preferences to use the old style, or you can switch at any time with the Change HUD Style command.
(t)mon nov 09 15
(u)Wire
(*)The highlight string functionality in the chat window will now only highlight matched words rather than the whole line.
(t)mon nov 02 15
(u)Haine
(*)Shocking Grasp is now Shocking Touch. It no longer instantly vaporizes people, and instead instantly puts them in crit, while stunning people nearby. Yes, I do hate fun, why do you ask?
(t)mon oct 26 15
(u)Wire
(*)Enabled tooltips on all the health HUD information (for Humans). They have the same description text as when they're clicked. I am unreasonably pleased with how this turned out.
(t)thu oct 22 15
(u)Haine
(*)Eye surgery! It's janky and awful. Probably also buggy. Let me know on the forums!
(*)It's spoon-scalpel-spoon, and you need to use both tools with the hand on the same side as the eye you want to do surgery on. Right hand for right eye, left for left, like that. It was either this, or pop-up prompts.
(*)Eventually surgery in general will be re-written and this will all be less stupid. For now, though, please enjoy this terrible mess.
(t)wed oct 21 15
(u)Haine
(*)Pills no longer need something to be in a beaker/whatever already to be dissolved. Realistic? No. More fun? Yes.
(t)sat oct 17 15
(u)Convair
(*)Buffed the Staff of Cthulhu a little to hopefully make it a more viable choice, especially when considering that you have to sacrifice a spell slot for the thing.
(*)Use the associated ability and it'll magically show up in your hand (or on the floor if you have both hands full), and the staff is also a slightly better melee weapon than before.
(t)thu oct 08 15
(u)Wire
(*)Tooltip support for pod UI buttons
(t)tue oct 06 15
(u)Wire
(*)Added some swanky tooltips to the game. They appear for most ability buttons in the top left of your screen.
(*)A notable omission are pod buttons. They're a bit more difficult.
(*)This is using some hitherto unknown black magic to pull off and could be either very laggy or just plain broken so uh, we'll see how this goes.
(t)mon oct 05 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Guess what. NI3 got ran into the ground. You horrible jerks.
(*)Now it's gone until I can work out what to do with it.
(t)wed sep 30 15
(u)Convair
(*)Given that very little nuke round development took place since May, it seemed appropriate to finally make some simple but significant adjustments based on user feedback.
(*)Added seven new target areas. Some are more in the crew's favour than others, but they're all temporary and will have to be rebalanced for Cogmap 2 anyway.
(*)Timer now defaults to 8 min, and unscrewing the nuke halves the countdown instead of dropping it to 60 seconds. The good ol' auth disk can be inserted to add (crew member) or shave off (nuke ops) 3 min once, but this is entirely optional.
(*)The Syndicate leader spawns with an old-fashioned auth disk pinpointer. His team may want to use it to infiltrate the station stealthily in preparation for the main strike.
(*)Made the nuke invulnerable to explosions (shame on you, suicide bombers). However, it actually takes damage from melee attacks now, and a couple of people with looted eswords will make short work of it. Unchanged: you can also shoot, laser or EMP the nuke.
(*)Removed some 2011-era code that would magically teleport the nuke back to Z1 under certain circumstances. The pod method of dealing with the nuke should be more reliable as a result.
(*)Late-joining antagonists no longer make an appearance in this game mode.
(t)sat sep 26 15
(u)Keelin
(*)Added an option to select your prefered targeting cursor to player preferences.
(*)Ported over number binding for abilities to changelings, wizards and vampires. ctrl+shift click an ability to enable binding mode, then press a number you want bound to that ability. This only works in WASD mode.
(*)Made some changeling and wizard abilities "sticky". This means they will stay on your cursor after using them unless they are on cooldown afterwards. Clikcing their button again or pressing the assigned hotkey again will remove them from your cursor.
(t)fri sep 25 15
(u)SpyGuy + FreshLemon
(*)Mentoring HotawhatBaabhabhiat (did I spell that right? I got no idea)
(t)thu sep 24 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Fixed a longstanding issue where monkies would be nonresponsive to rajaijah. This probably pleases a handful of people.
(t)wed sep 23 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Fixed explosions doing no damage to people.
(*)Nerfed pipe bombs because by default they should not be able to gib a dude. Sorry guys, you'll just have to make them stronger if you want to do that.
(t)thu sep 17 15
(u)Wire
(*)Reduced the resource file even further (by another 20mb or so) with help from ErikHanson.
(*)Some sounds might be a bit off! There's like 2000+ sound files so we couldn't test them all. If you spot one that does, please post in this topic: http://forum.ss13.co/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=5865
(t)wed sep 16 15
(u)Wire
(*)Ok it's back in (with some additional help from ErikHanson), this time the sprites shouldn't be visibly affected.
(*)HAHA JUST KIDDING OF COURSE THIS FUCKED STUFF UP. OF. COURSE. (Changes reverted)
(*)Reduced the resource filesize by like 25mb or so because I'm freakin' awesome.
(*)Ok it's like, 90% because Somepotato made a thing for me but I'm still taking the credit ok.
(t)mon sep 07 15
(u)Wire
(*)Fixing up a bunch of popups that I probably broke with the CDN introduction. This includes: the Material Recombobulator, the Workbench (smelter) and the Artifact Research Computer.
(*)Fix for the traits popup appearing underneath the top byond titlebar, preventing movement/closing.
(t)wed sep 02 15
(u)Convair
(*)Due to popular demand, wrestling moves don't use manual aiming anymore in case there's only one target nearby.
(*)Inconsistent behavior is unintuitive to some extent (and was the motivation for that particular change), but it's acceptable if you prefer the status quo.
(t)tue sep 01 15
(u)Convair
(*)Sprites for all changeling abilities have been added, courtesy of Sundance420.
(t)mon aug 31 15
(u)Convair
(*)Wrestling belts no longer use the legacy verb-based system.
(t)fri aug 28 15
(u)Haine
(*)Radioactive Blowouts were disabled for a little bit and now have been enabled again after some fixes.
(*)PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF: you get irradiated in an area where you don't think you should get irradiated during a blowout.
(t)wed aug 26 15
(u)Hull
(*)Added some protection for wraiths losing both of their lives too quickly. Added: New genetic effect, chemical, and food.
(t)tue aug 25 15
(u)Convair
(*)Vampire: did away with the legacy verb-based system. Abilities should be easier to use as a result, and provide better feedback to the player.
(t)mon aug 24 15
(u)Wire
(*)Enabled what I'm calling "CDN resource mode". This basically stops byond from sending you files necessary for popups and such, and instead links to where they are hosted on an external server (goonhub).
(*)This replaces the resource preloader thing and will eliminate all popup related lag. Aside from that, you shouldn't notice much difference.
(*)However, if you do spot a popup with a broken image or broken styling or whatever, please let me know.
(t)sun aug 23 15
(u)Haine
(*)Added an AZERTY mode for WASD hotkeys.  Look for the toggles in the Toggles tab and your character preferences.
(u)Daeren
(*)IT'S A WRAITH REBALANCE HOEDOWN, EVERYBODY GET HYPE
(*)After a bunch of testing and discussion I've made a bunch of changes, some major and some minor. If it goes well I might bump up wraith spawn rate.
(*)The Big Change: Absorb Corpse's cooldown starts at 45 seconds and scales exponentially with each use. Much faster early game, much harder to get into scientific notation with your wraith points.
(*)The Big Change 2: Wraiths can only survive one banishment now, instead of two. When banished, Absorb Corpse's scaling and cooldown are reset.
(*)Revenants make a bigger, angrier red message when animated.
(*)Push has apparently had a very long-standing bug where it didnt work right on objects or doors, w h o o p s that's fixed now.
(*)Possess Object's cooldown reduced by 30 seconds.
(*)Salt lines can now be destroyed by careless foot traffic. Walking dramatically reduces the chance to scuff up a salt line, but its still not a great idea to put them in incredibly high traffic areas. Try using walls or redundant layers.
(*)If you notice any added bugs or weirdness dial 1-800-IMC-ODER
(*)These tweaks, as always, are subject to re-tweaking based on further testing and input.
(t)thu aug 20 15
(u)Wire
(*)I know this changelog window is looking a little weird around the titlebar (probably). No need to message me about it, I'll fix it when I'm not hella tired.
(t)sun aug 16 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Adding gimmick reasons / details to assassination missions. Make sure your targets know WHY they're on the list!
(*)Huge thanks to, in no particular order, ErikHanson, Nurdock, Azungar, Nitrous, Dabir, Xavieri, oxy and Gannets for the great help in coming up with these!
(u)Haine
(*)Added a command to toggle seeing mentorhelps on or off for mentors.  Somehow we made it this long without having that.  Whoops!
(*)May be buggy, I can't really test it fully by myself.  Let me know if there's a problem!
(t)fri aug 14 15
(u)Convair
(*)Added shortcuts for the AI's internal radios. Prefix your message with ':1', ':2' or ':3' respectively.
(*)AI shells and AI-controlled cyborgs can also use them, assuming you have a mainframe and it isn't incapacitated.
(t)thu aug 13 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Modified the resource distribution code to make joining rounds smoother.
(*)In case any web-based interfaces / windows behave strangely, please report it on the forums.
(t)sun aug 09 15
(u)Convair
(*)AI shells and AI-controlled cyborgs now have access to the 'Open nearest door' verb.
(u)SpyGuy
(*)The AI changing its status will now be reflected on the core as well.
(*)It can also set its own colour at will.
(*)Nukeops pinpointers now point to the nuke instead.
(t)sat aug 08 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)A new attachment for tank transfer valves! Wow!
(*)More pressure = more better.
(t)thu aug 06 15
(u)volundr
(*)Made atmos drain rooms with holes in them much faster. This causes less lag, but has the side effect of making you die. Wear internals when shit gets busted.
(*)Fixed a memory leak related to animation and matrix transforms. Should make for much less round-end lag.
(t)fri jul 31 15
(u)Convair
(*)Fixed click-dragging barcode labels onto crates and stuff. Cyborgs might find it useful.
(*)Also fixed the optical meson upgrade for cyborgs.
(t)thu jul 16 15
(u)Convair
(*)Certain assemblies are somewhat more flexible now:
(*)Mousetrap bomb (+ non-chem grenade), mousetrap car (+ non-chem grenade and pipe bomb), suicide bomb vest (+ non-chem grenade and pipe bomb).
(u)Haine
(*)The ice moon lattice bug should be fixed now. Lemme know if not.
(t)wed jul 15 15
(u)Haine
(*)ProDocs now accept health analyzer upgrades.  This lets them scan people's health from a distance.  Click on the goggles in-hand to toggle it.
(*)Fixed up pens and the like so that they use fancy fonts again.
(*)Everyone now starts with a (probably) unique handwriting style and signature.
(t)tue jul 14 15
(u)Wire
(*)Fiddled with the status tab area a bit. Removed the "Game" tab. Let me know of any formatting issues.
(u)Infinite Monkeys
(*)You can now name your save profiles. The name is displayed instead of a number under the Load menu.
(*)Heads can now be impaled on rods, up to three per rod.
(t)mon jul 13 15
(u)Wire
(*)Three new buttons in the top-right with corresponding verbs. Will open up relevent pages in your browser. No more lazy people mentorhelping for the wiki.
(*)The chat should possibly maybe preserve history on round restart now (instead of clearing). We'll see if this actually works.
(u)Infinite Monkeys
(*)Syndicate and Wizard modes will no longer end instantly if the antagonists die. Instead, once they are all dead late join antagonists may begin to appear. This won't happen if the bad guys are kept alive and locked up somewhere!
(*)You can now chop off people's limbs from the strip menu while holding certain items. This is slower than surgery, but only requires them to be unable to move.
(t)fri jul 10 15
(u)Infinite Monkeys
(*)The power transmission laser's earnings are no longer linear. Feedback is needed on the forums - even just posting data on round duration, peak laser output and your earnings would be helpful!
(*)The PTL beam will now change alpha depending on how much power it is transmitting.
(t)thu jul 09 15
(u)Wire
(*)Prototype popup window reskin thing! Only applied to this very changelog window at the moment.
(*)If it completely messes up for you, just use the "Changelog" verb again to close the window manually.
(*)Major credit to <b>Somepotato</b> for the original idea and code.
(t)wed jul 08 15
(u)Infinite Monkeys
(*)Added a load more object suicides. See if you can find them all!
(t)sat jul 04 15
(u)Haine
(*)Underwear now works like hair and all that other nonsense and your old underwear choices are probably now broken, so go re-clothe yourselves you naked freaks.
(*)The thing that randomizes appearances now works the same regardless of if you're doing it via the character options panel or a DNA scrambler.  It used to be two similar but different sets of code.  Might be a bit buggy from the change, let me know.
(t)mon jun 29 15
(u)Convair
(*)The captain's antique laser gun can now be repaired. How? Up to you to find out.
(*)You may want to use some decent-quality replacement parts, though.
(u)Haine
(*)You can now use an AI interface board in place of a brain when making a cyborg.  This allows the AI to use the borg's body.  This is a terribly hacky mess and it's undoubtedly still buggy for the moment.
(*)AI shells can now be built with any power cell you'd like.  Why would you use a really big cell in a shell?  Who knows, but you can.
(t)thu jun 24 15
(u)Haine
(*)Another stationary chemicompiler in the test chamber itself.
(t)wed jun 24 15

(t)mon jun 22 15
(u)I Said No
(*)Additional genetics UI tweaks. Markers will now turn white when you have the correct sequence.
(*)Added Autocomplete feature. If you have already activated a gene once, you can hit autocomplete to get the sequence. Encryption locks must still be broken, however.
(*)Added Booster Gene Y and Booster Gene Z.
(*)High Complexity DNA is easier to unlock now (2 locks instead of 4), and also can be used as a wildcard in gene combination.
(*)Appearance and Body Type are now fully accessible from the beginning.
(*)Removed: Booster Gene Q, Saturated Junk DNA, Hair Follicle Research, Body Type Research
(u)Haine
(*)Removed a bunch of sprites that were no longer needed - if you see something weird happening with clothing like a missing sprite, please let me know.
(t)sun jun 21 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Adding an automatic ban for clientside mods that affect data being sent to the server.
(*)In case you are running any sort of mods and still wish to play here you should disable them now.
(*)If you don't know if your client is modded or not it isn't.
(u)Convair
(*)Reworked medical sleepers, which should now be capable of keeping light-crit patients stabilized for a reasonable amount of time (as opposed to being pretty much pointless).
(*)They're still no substitute for a doctor, but it should buy you enough time to grab the right type of medicine from the medical vendor or something.
(u)Hull
(*)Split medbay off into seperate areas for the lobby and operating theater which should spread out the APC drain.
(t)wed jun 17 15
(u)I Said No
(*)Genetics interface changed a bit. Grey genes have not been researched, yellow ones have been researched but not activated, and green ones have been activated.
(*)Fixed a bug that prevented you from adding stored mutations to a subject.
(u)Convair
(*)The experimental generator (available through QM) is now capable of charging APCs, and I also buffed the charge rate.
(t)tue jun 16 15
(u)Convair
(*)Back end changes to porters (Port-a-Brig etc) and old (non-PDA) remotes.
(*)Home turf and remote-to-device link aren't hard-coded anymore. Click-drag the machine onto a floor tile to designate it as the new home location.
(*)You can order additional Port-a-Brigs from the cargo bay if you so desire.
(t)sun jun 14 15
(u)Infinite Monkeys
(*)You can now buy things directly from the Supply Request Console outside the Quartermasters' Office using money from your personal account. It's still delivered to the same place, though, so you'll need the quartermasters to give it to you.
(t)sat jun 13 15
(u)Convair
(*)Added Port-a-NanoMed remote to most medical PDAs, and a Port-a-Sci remote to the RD's PDA.
(u)I Said No
(*)Activators that have successfully activated a power in a human (not monkeys!) can be recycled by putting them back in the genetics terminal.
(*)Doing this yields various rewards, and will decrease research costs and times up to a cap.
(*)One of the new rewards is Chromosomes, which can be used on activated mutations to improve them in various ways.
(*)The research time and cost reduction research articles are gone, as they are obsolete due to activator recycling.
(*)Booster Gene A, B and C are also gone as they were obsoleted by the new chromosomes feature.
(t)wed jun 10 15
(u)Convair
(*)Security and HoS PDAs now come pre-loaded with a Port-a-Brig remote. Also added a few blank PDAs to the sec vending machine, considering that redshirts are a frequent target for PDA bombers.
(u)Wire
(*)New 'Link IRC' verb. Associates your byond username with your irc nickname. Will be useful in the future for certain IRC bot commands.
(u)I Said No
(*)Genetics can now access DNA samples directly from the station's medical database instead to having to scan them.
(*)Activating a gene from someone's latent pool no longer causes any stability loss.
(*)Geneticists can now create Activator syringes, which only activate latent powers.
(*)Fixed a few interface bugs in the genetics computer.
(t)tue jun 09 15

(*)Your customization choices preview should sync up with what you actually get in game now.
(t)mon jun 08 15
(u)I Said No
(*)Meteor Shield Generators now use far less power. Due to some other unlisted changes, I strongly recommend taking advantage of this buff.
(t)sun jun 07 15
(u)Infinite Monkeys
(*)The power transmission laser can now instantly detonate people at high enough energies.
(*)Improved the controls for input and output of the laser.
(t)fri jun 05 15
(u)Haine
(*)New and improved escape shuttle!  It now spends a bit of time in transit to centcom before arriving.  Buckle up!
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Changes to how human icons are handled. Please report any bugs or strange behaviour you find.
(u)I Said No
(*)Traitor objectives have been messed with. There are now many more combinations of objectives available, in addition to some all-new objectives:
(*)Damage Area: Cause a significant amount of damage to a chosen room.
(*)Destroy Equipment: Destroy all instances of a chosen piece of equipment on the station.
(*)Job Genocide: Kill all crewmembers of a particular job.
(*)Off the Heads: Kill all the head personnel.
(*)No Clones: Make sure no cloned crew survive.

(*)New pod secondary system: Ore Scoop. Drive over ore to pick it up, clickdrag the pod to a nearby tile to unload it.
(*)New pod comms system part: Magnet Link Array. Allows you to control the mining magnet from within 7 tiles from inside a pod.
(*)The mining department now starts with a Mineral Accumulator.
(t)tue jun 02 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)Tweaked critter backend, should significantly reduce lag.
(*)Critters might be lazier as a result. Please report any issues.
(u)I Said No
(*)Pod communication systems are now used to interface with dock controls. If you don't have a comms system or you have the wrong one, you'll be denied access.
(*)Syndicate pods start with a different communications system to station pods. You can't just go in through the pod bays anymore.
(u)Haine
(*)There's now a civilian radio channel, for chefs/botanists/etc.
(t)sun may 31 15
(u)Marquesas
(*)New stock market event type.
(*)Also adjusted the effects events have. Overall, they should leave a larger dent. Or a larger profit in your hands.
(u)Convair
(*)Gun components have finally been updated for the new projectile code.
(u)Infinite Monkeys
(*)Engineers can now sell power with a giant laser. Thanks to Gannets for the awesome sprites! It'll definitely need adjusting so please leave feedback on the forums.

(u)Convair
(*)Light bulb fixture parts can now be crafted from metal sheets. Also fixed the bug that made it impossible to attach them to reinforced walls.
(u)Keelin
(*)Fixed the fat trait swallowing your PDA and ID and such. They can now be found in your backpack.
(*)Short-sighted trait now spawns you with glasses.
(*)Toned down kleptomaniac slightly and made sure it only fires when you're alive.
(*)Career alcoholic will now only somewhat slur your speech.
(*)Traits are now visible in the medical records.
(*)New traits: Deaf, Adamantium skeleton, Cat eyes, Infravision, Spacephobia, Robust genetics, Good genes, Bad genes.
(*)Removed Trait: Overly soggy
(*)Mutations gained through traits will now show up in your notes.
(u)Haine
(*)Fixed not being able to unlock APCs with a PDA that has an ID in it. Made swapping IDs quicker, just click with the new one and the old one will automatically be ejected.
(t)tue may 26 15
(u)SpyGuy
(*)The pray verb returns. Use it to in an attempt to gain the attention of whatever god happens to be listening.
(*)Note that divine attention may not be something you want and it might not end well for you. Use at your own peril.
(*)Also there's a high chance that nobody is listening, but you never know...
(u)Keelin
(*)First batch of traits.
(*)All traits are subject to change. Especially ones that change damage, health or stamina. They are controversial and we're just gonna test this for a bit.
(t)mon may 25 15
(u)I Said No

(*)Nuclear Emergency mode has been substantially changed. The operatives must now take the bomb to a specific location on the station, arm it, and then make sure it detonates.
(*)The crew ideally must prevent the bomb from being armed, but if it is it can either be destroyed by various means or unanchored by using a screwdriver and taken off the station map to avoid the station's destruction.
(*)The nuclear bomb can be loaded into pods. Also, the nuclear disk no longer exists. Good riddance.

(*)Automatic updates (descriptions and icons where applicable) for all ammo boxes. Guns can be examined to check the current ammo type, and also be unloaded at will. The .357 Mag revolver can chamber .38 Spc rounds like in RL.
(*)Spent casings are now a thing. Some guns eject them automatically (shotguns, .22 pistol), others on reload (revolvers, zip gun). And yes, the forensic profile of the gun is taken into account.

(*)After the barrage of genetics nerfs it's time to tweak one that was probably too punishing in retrospect.
(*)This wasn't in the changelog before now (I think) but the feature is this: Powers give you genetic instability. The lower it is, the more Terrible Things happen to you.
(*)The change: BAD mutations now give you MORE stability, and low stability doesn't make you mutate like you gargled with the Ooze from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
(*)Yes, this means that if you want to activate a bunch of superpowers at once, you will either deal with the Bad Shit that happens with low stability or you need to layer Bad Shit on yourself with bad mutations. IMO this is way more entertaining than just having an arbitrary "fuck you" limit.
(*)The actual stability increases and decreases for certain genes have been tweaked a bit, and may require further balancing after "playtesting" (watching people run shit into the ground), so please give your input on the forums/to admins/whatever if you've got a bone to pick about the new system.

(*)We took away the Port-A-Genes too while we were at it because wow, THAT experiment backfired!
(*)Nearly forgot, we put safety inhibitors in the enzymatic reclaimer so you can't just stuff living people that have mildly annoyed you inside without emagging it first.

(*)Late changelog entry: Genetics has been messed with. There's a bunch of new powers, and the rarity ratios have been re-adjusted.
(*)There is now a tier 3 research item that allows you to store mutations in the genetics scanner, whereupon they can be inserted back into a different subject, have injectors made of them, or be combined with other mutations to create new ones.

(*)Stamina icon on your HUD will now report details of your stamina if you click on any part of it, not just the stamina bar itself.
(*)The Robotics operating computer will no longer tie itself to an operating table on Mars.
(*)Implants weren't properly being cut out of people; the implant itself wasn't being relocated, so cutting one out from someone just sorta made an empty case and never actually removed the thing - except from the list of implants in the person, so then you could <b>never</b> get it out.

(*)Telepads for Mechanics Lab. You also need to have a Multitool to change most Components and their Connections now.
(*)Added Toggle and Selection Components.
(*)LED Components now change their own Color to the set Color when activated. This should make it easier to tell if they are on or not.

(*)Intended to re-work some HUD code, turns out the whole thing was the worlds worst jenga possible, reworked the code for all storage items (+ their HUD) and grabs.
(*)As usual bug me in IRC/adminhelp if anything behaves unusually, with the code managable I'm hoping to be able to land a few feature goodies however.

(*)Various changes made over the past few days:
(*)Mechanics and the Chief Engineer now get a Deconstruction Device that can deconstruct anything a mechanic has deployed.
(*)Mechanics have been switched over to using manufacturers rather than circuitry pieces for construction.
(*)Cargo Pads for Mechanic's Lab and Robotics.
(*)The Artifact Lab heater pad now gives a little more useful information.
(*)Artifacts now display small hints when you touch them. This mostly determines their origin, but can sometimes give hints as to their function.
(*)A bunch of new artifacts. What do they do? Find out for yourself!
(*)Radiation Storm random event redone. You now have to dodge radioactive pulses rather than getting unavoidably irradiated.
(*)Black Hole event tweaked a bit. There will be a few seconds warning in the vincinity when a black hole is about to spawn.
(*)Computer consoles now give feedback if you're doing something wrong when trying to construct them.
(*)The old teleporter (the one in a closet near the owlery) is now a bit more modular and doesn't need to be built in a specific order or layout, as long as all pieces are within two tiles of each other.
(*)One portal generator and computer can also support multiple portal rings at once.

(*)Messed around with Meteor Shield Generators a bit. They have snazzy new icons, can have their shield range set by using the right click menu, and will tell you about their power consumption rates when examined.
(*)Recycling units can be set to retain any resources they output internally. This should be very convenient when combined with communal pooling.
(*)You can drag and drop any manufacturing unit onto a floor, table, rack, openable crate, or functioning manufacturing unit to make it output anything manufactured or ejected there.
(*)A recycling unit for the Mechanic's Workshop.
(-)

(u)I Said No
(*)Sped up drag-loading items into a manufacturing unit. Note: Doing it from a closed crate is instant and always has been.
(*)Manufacturers that start the round in the same room now pool their resources communally between each other. This can be toggled on or off per unit.
(*)Robotics Manufacturers now have two new recipes that essentially combine all the robot part recipes into one, for convenience. There's one for Standard and Light model cyborgs.
(-)
(t)sun jan 05 14
(u)I Said No
(*)The repeat function in manufacturing units will now go onto the next queue item rather than stopping once it runs out of resources.
(*)Click-drag the manufacturer onto a nearby crate or turf, and it will output any ejected or manufactured items there until it no longer can, at which point it reverts to its own tile.

(*)Mechanics have a limited selection of new Toys to play with.
(*)They and a book containing Instructions have been dumped right next to the door.
(*)Again, this is highly experimental - try not to be idiots with it or you won't get new toys.
(-)
(u)I Said No
(*)Added the ability to print Blueprints from scanned Ruckingenur Kit entries. These blueprints can be used in new Reverse-Engineering Fabricators as an alternate method to the old circuit board stuff in Mechanics.

(*)Manufacturing Units can now be damaged and destroyed by beating, shooting or generally just abusing them.
(*)They can also be repaired or deconstructed. To repair, open the panel and use wiring for severe damage, or welding for light damage.
(*)To deconstruct, start by using a wrench on the unit. Examining the unit each step will tell you what to do from there.

(*)Robotics manufacturers can make more staplers
(*)Most belts can now hold a wire variety of tiny/small-sized items instead of super-specific boring lists
(*)See some jerk standing on a chair? Try folding it under them.
(*)Hard counter added for meth/stim-addled wrestler rampages:
(*)MD and Armory now have tranq rifles. Welp.
(*)Haloperdol was always meant to be the tool of choice against drug-fueled rampages, but it was too hard to dose them
(*)These darts contain that stuff, 10u per shot divided by target's armor class.
(*)It's less obnoxious than the old sleeptox syringe gun vigilantes, I hope - shorter naptime.
(*)Try not to make me regret adding these.
(*)Also the guards have a smoke launcher now, use it for mildly-hazardous area denial against crowds I guess? w/e
(*)That's pretty much the role pepperfoam was meant for, as a step towards this thing.
(-)

(u)Dr. Cogwerks
(*)Added a new traitor item: WRESTLING BELT
(*)It may have a few things left to iron out, but it should be mostly functional now.
(*)Slam and Throw actions with the wrestling belt require an active grab on someone
(*)Action cooldown delays for the wrestling actions can be reduced by coffee, sugar, nicotine, meth, crank, bathsalts, etc.
(*)Zipguns can now be assembled
(*)Pipebombs can be packed with: fuel, black powder, plasmastone, or erebite

(*)Clicking on a reagent container (beakers, buckets, medicine bottles, etc.) in the active hand will switch between a firm and loose grip on them.
(*)Switching to firm grip will cause you to pour out the container's transfer volume when you click on something while loose grip will splash the entire contents.
(*)There is now a confirmation for emptying out plant pots with viable plants in them.
(*)Clicking on equipped stacks of metal, glass, and rods with an empty hand will now allow you to specify the number to take from the existing stack, instead of grabbing one at a time.

(*)Mechanic PDAs now have all the network diagnostic apps
(*)The comments field in QM crate ordering now works as a destination barcode, but ONLY IF you write the proper destination format.
(*)Derringer bullets now pierce armor.
(*)Speaking of armor, I changed a lot of armor stuff a couple weeks ago to use variable armor class multipliers instead of hardcoded amounts
(*)Some things in the suit slot will do slightly different amounts of projectile protection now. Industrial armor is better than ever.
(*)Syndicate space suits, captain's space suit, captain's armor, and some other stuff like that are now a little better than before.
(*)Some suits that aren't armor will soak up a little bit of projectile damage now, even if they aren't bullet-stoppers.

(*)Experimenting with Creative EAX 3D sound and environment functionality!
(*)This means that you all should hook up surround sound systems for the ultimate highly visceral 2D spaceman multimedia experience!
(*)Some areas may sound strange as we are tweaking the environments.
(*)Positional audio not fully implemented, so expect longer sounds to not update their position as they are playing.
(*)Sound ranges may be higher or lower than expected, we are tweaking that, too.

(*)Randomly-generated goofy cyberpunk drug cocktails can be found scattered around in those ??? pill bottles.
(*)Die a Glorious Death objective returns.
(*)Nuclear self-destruct objective returns. Nuke charge is in the mainframe core below the AI.
(*)Setting off the self-destruct erases the mainframe room, AI core, most of engineering, and wrecks a fairly wide area.
(*)Derringers will fit into a pocket now if you want a quieter way to retrieve them, although *wink is still cooler.
(*)NEW HOTKEYS FOR EMOTES #WOW #WHOA
(*)Ctrl-A: Salute | Ctrl-W: Wink
