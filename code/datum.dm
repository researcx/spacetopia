// this pattern might seem redundant but it ensures objects aren't disposed twice.
// it also proides a quick way to check if an object you're using was disposed but never deleted by the garbage collector because of your reference
// the point of this is to reduce code duplication. cleanup code only needs to exist one time in disposing() and it will be called whether the object is deleted with del() or dispose()
