    <p>1. Your goal is to kill all heads of staff on the station. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Captain, Head of Personnel, Head of Security,<br>
      </li>
      <li>Chief Engineer, Research Director, Medical Director<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. The Syndicate will support you. Use the <em>Notes</em> verb to learn how to unlock your PDA or radio uplink.</p>

    <p>3. Avoid civilian casualties and convert other players to revolutionaries instead by using a flash on them. Heads of staff, synthetics and security personnel cannot be converted.</p>
