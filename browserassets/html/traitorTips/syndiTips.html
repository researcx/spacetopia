	<p>1. <em>Your goal</em> is to move the nuke onto the station and activate it there.<br>
		<span class="small">The precise location is recorded in the <em>audio log</em> and also viewable through the <em>Notes</em> verb.</span></p>
			
	<p class="image-right">2. Each operative starts with a <em>Syndicate uplink</em>.<br>
		<img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/syndie-radio.png")}}" class="right" />
		<span class="small">Each uplink has 12 telecrystals, which are <b>not</b> shared between all uplinks.<br>
		However, it can still be worthwhile to plan your purchases with your fellow operatives.</span></p>

	<p>3. Optionally, the captain's <em>authentication disk</em> can be used to shorten the countdown. The Syndicate leader spawns with a special version of the pinpointer that tracks the disk instead of the nuclear bomb.</p>

	<p>4. Teamplay is key! <em>Discuss the mission</em> with your comrades and come up with a solid plan <em>before</em> anybody heads out. Use your headset to stay in touch:<br><br>
	   <span class="small">say :h I'm about to activate the nuke in security. Stick together, boys!</span></p>

	<p>5. To exit the shuttle, stand on the <em>teleporter pad</em> and use your <em>teleporter remote</em>. This will take you to the listening post. You return to the shuttle in the same way. The station is to the <em>north-west</em> of the listening post.<br>
	      <span class="small">Alternatively, take a pod and open a wormhole leading to the station. Pods <em>cannot warp back</em> to the Syndicate shuttle, however.</span></p>
		
	<p class="image-right">6. To trigger the nuke:<br>
		<img src="{{resource("images/antagTips/nuke.png")}}" class="right" />
		<span class="small indent">
			1. Load the nuke into one of your pods and drop it off near the station.<br>
			2. Move the nuke to the designated area.<br>
			3. Click on the nuke with an empty hand to activate it. That will prompt a station-wide red alert, stating your exact location.<br>
			4. Insert the authentication disk if you have it.<br>
			5. Defend the nuke until the countdown reaches zero. It's all or nothing!<br>
			6. Gloat over the radio and vanish in a cloud of radioactive fire!<br>
