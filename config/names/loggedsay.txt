Young man - there's a place you can go.
I said young man, when you're short on your dough.
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find many ways to have a good time.
I love Naruto.
I love anime, what about you?
Piss off, I'm powering up to SSJ!
I am Android Data in disguise!
Kill the nudists!
No.
Monkeys was here '12!!!
Yes.
Get out.
Gentlemen, our goal at this point seems clear enough: this version has to become just as good if not better as the goon version already is. That is, it should contain every single feature their version has, but better.
I have decided to take on a more aggressive attitude: if I don't see a sufficient amount of players on the server *and* active, I'm shutting it down until enough requests are made to put it back up. I don't give a rats ass how many different versions there are. You pick a side: me, or them. If you choose me, you better be here and not on any other servers. If you choose them, enjoy the horrible administration that ensues because of it. Thank you for wasting my time yet again.
Here's the deal: if you fear me, continue your ranting. If you don't, just bugger off and continue with your lives instead of wasting time here.
